NodeJs: File System Read
Your company has recently started working extensively with the file system. As
the NodeJs Developer in your company, you have been tasked to write a script
that reads JSON files effectively. Your job is to write a script with a function
that takes care of reading the file from the file system, handle errors if any,
and return the data in a JSON format.

Functionality
The script should implement the following functionalities:

- Read JSON File: The function should accept the fully resolved file path as the
 input and return a Promise that resolves with the parsed JSON data contained in
  the file.

- Error Handling: The following errors should be handled and appropriately
returned:
    - File does not exist: If the file does not exist, reject the function with
    an Error object with the message 'File does not exist.'

    - The passed File is a directory. If the path specified to the function is a
     directory, reject the Function with an Error object with the message 'Path
     is a directory.'

    - Contents of the file are not valid JSON: If the data contained in the file
     is not a valid JSON, reject the function with an Error object with the
     message: 'JSON invalid.'

Note: A test JSON file named data.json is present in the root directory of the
question to perform read operations.

Function Description:
- The function should take the fully resolved path to the file as input and
return a Promise that resolves with a valid JSON containing the file contents.

- The file index.js should contain the function, and the function should be the
default export of the file.

const main = function() {
    ...
};

module.exports = main;
